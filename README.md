In this homework, a search engine is created. The speed of different data structures for your search engine architecture is compared. The search engines in real life search hundreds of millions web pages to see if they have the words that you have typed, and they can do this for thousands of users at a given time. In order to do these searches really fast, search engines such as Google do a lot of what we call preprocessing of the pages they search; that is, they transform the contents of a web page (which for the purposes of this homework, we will assume it consists of only strings) into a structure that can be searched very fast.
In this homework, reading the input files, and storing them into the vector. The vector with several sorting algorithms are:
1. Quick Sort,
2. Insertion Sort,
3. Merge Sort 
4. Heap Sort.
I want to see which of the sorting algorithms is more efficient. Next, after getting a query from the user, words in a vector with the binary search algorithm searched.
